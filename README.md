# Questionnaire Report

This generic *default* template for [Data Stewardship Wizard](https://ds-wizard.org) (DSW) directly transforms answers from a questionnaire into a document while maintaining the structure. It is not tied to any knowledge model and is included by default in every DSW instance.
